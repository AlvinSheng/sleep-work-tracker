It seems like a good way to make it to early appointments when your sleep schedule is very late, vs. getting up earlier. The tiredness from the virtual all-nighter can actually overcome the insomnia of the next night, whereas getting up earlier tends not to. I aim to have a consistent wake up time of 7 am, no matter what. So if I'm very sleepy from a virtual all-nighter, I should aim to sleep at 7-7:30 pm (to get ~12 hours sleep). For the too early sleep, try to trigger it by sleeping at 11 pm; if you end up actually sleeping through to 7am, that's great. If you still get up too early, it should be late enough such that you can make it to 7 pm without crashing. I should use this strategy very sparingly, since it relies on caffeine and is pretty unhealthy in terms of sleep hygiene. You may have to continue the alternatesleepdepriv strategy just for this week, i.e., sleep deprivation on Monday (this night), Wed, Fri, and Sun.
